## Description

Outfit Forecast is a feature-rich web application built with React that empowers fashion-conscious travelers to plan their outfits wisely based on real-time weather forecasts. By seamlessly integrating Google Maps Geocode API and OpenWeather's Weather API, users can easily search for weather information in different locations and save preferred destinations for instant weather updates.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Forecasts:** Utilize the power of OpenWeather's Weather API to fetch accurate and up-to-date weather data for any desired location.

- **Location Search:** Users can conveniently search for weather information in various locations using Google Maps Geocode API, making trip planning a breeze.

- **Saved Locations:** Allow users to save and unsave preferred locations to receive instant weather updates without having to search repeatedly.

- **Responsive Design:** Outfit Forecast boasts a responsive user interface that adapts flawlessly to different devices, ensuring a seamless experience across smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

- **Error Handling:** Implemented an error handling page to provide users with a friendly interface in case of any unexpected issues.

- **Cypress Testing:** Comprehensive end-to-end testing with Cypress ensures app reliability and robustness.
