## Description

Outfit Forecast is a feature-rich web application built with React that empowers fashion-conscious travelers to plan their outfits wisely based on real-time weather forecasts. By seamlessly integrating Google Maps Geocode API and OpenWeather's Weather API, users can easily search for weather information in different locations and save preferred destinations for instant weather updates.

## Features

- **Saved Locations:** Allow users to save and unsave preferred locations to receive instant weather updates without having to search repeatedly.

## Deployment

The Outfit Forecast app is deployed using Vercel and is accessible at [https://vercel.com/jade-zs/outfit-forecast](https://vercel.com/jade-zs/outfit-forecast).

## Future Plans

As part of future development, I plan to create a backend app to support personalized clothing recommendations based on different weather conditions. Although currently, a fashion API with free access is unavailable, the backend app will allow users to receive customized cloth recommendations to make their travel experience even more delightful.
